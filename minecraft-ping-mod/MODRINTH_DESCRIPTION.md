# simpleMultiplayerPing

A ping mod that allows players to create groups and share temporary pings on multiplayer servers. You can place a ping with a mouse wheel click, or hold the mouse wheel to open a ping wheel with advanced options.

Only client-side installation is required, so the mod works on minigame servers (for example Hypixel). The relay server can be self-hosted, or you can use the public relay for free.

## Features

- Client-side only (no server plugin required)
- Temporary pings shared with your group
- Default party code `1` on server join
- Optional Party Menu (`P`) for custom groups
- 3 ping types:
  - `Normal` (mouse wheel click)
  - `Warning` (mouse wheel hold + pull up)
  - `Move` (mouse wheel hold + pull down)

## Settings (Mod Menu)

- Ping Color
- Ping Size
- Ping Duration
- Optional per-player colors
- Optional sender name display
- Relay host override
- Reset to defaults
